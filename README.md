# Breeze [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/scalanlp/breeze.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/scalanlp/breeze)

Breeze is a library for numerical processing. It aims to be generic, clean, and powerful without sacrificing (much) efficiency.

The current snapshot version is 0.13-0598e003cfa7f00f76919aa556009ad6d4fc1332. The latest release is 0.13.2, which is cross-built against Scala 2.10.x, 2.11.x and 2.12.x.


## Documentation

* https://github.com/scalanlp/breeze/wiki/Quickstart
* https://github.com/scalanlp/breeze/wiki/Linear-Algebra-Cheat-Sheet
* [Scaladoc](http://www.scalanlp.org/api/breeze/) (Scaladoc is typically horribly out of date, and not a good way to learn Breeze.)
* There is also the [scala-breeze google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/scala-breeze) for general questions and discussion.


## Using Breeze

### Building it yourself

This project can be built with SBT 0.13.x.

### SBT

For SBT 0.13.x and last stable release 0.13.2, add these lines to your SBT project definition:

```scala
libraryDependencies  ++= Seq(
  // Last stable release
  "org.scalanlp" %% "breeze" % "0.13.2",
  
  // Native libraries are not included by default. add this if you want them (as of 0.7)
  // Native libraries greatly improve performance, but increase jar sizes. 
  // It also packages various blas implementations, which have licenses that may or may not
  // be compatible with the Apache License. No GPL code, as best I know.
  "org.scalanlp" %% "breeze-natives" % "0.13.2",
  
  // The visualization library is distributed separately as well.
  // It depends on LGPL code
  "org.scalanlp" %% "breeze-viz" % "0.13.2"
)


resolvers += "Sonatype Releases" at "https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases/"
```

For SBT 0.13.x and last snapshot (currently 0.13-0598e003cfa7f00f76919aa556009ad6d4fc1332-SNAPSHOT), add these lines to your SBT project definition:

```scala
libraryDependencies  ++= Seq(
  // Last snapshot
  "org.scalanlp" %% "breeze" % "latest.integration",
  
  // Native libraries are not included by default. add this if you want them (as of 0.7)
  // Native libraries greatly improve performance, but increase jar sizes. 
  // It also packages various blas implementations, which have licenses that may or may not
  // be compatible with the Apache License. No GPL code, as best I know.
  "org.scalanlp" %% "breeze-natives" % "0.13-0598e003cfa7f00f76919aa556009ad6d4fc1332",
  
  // The visualization library is distributed separately as well. 
  // It depends on LGPL code.
  "org.scalanlp" %% "breeze-viz" % "0.13-0598e003cfa7f00f76919aa556009ad6d4fc1332"
)


resolvers += "Sonatype Snapshots" at "https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/"
```

For more details on the optional `breeze-natives` module, please watch Sam Halliday's talk at Scala eXchange 2014 [High Performance Linear Algebra in Scala](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/5849-high-performance-linear-algebra-in-scala) ([follow along with high-res slides](http://fommil.github.io/scalax14/#/)).


### Maven

Maven looks like this:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.scalanlp</groupId>
  <artifactId>breeze_2.10</artifactId> <!-- or 2.11 -->
  <version>0.13.2</version>
</dependency>
```

### Other build tools
http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.scalanlp/breeze_2.12/0.13.2 (as an example) is a great resource for finding other configuration examples for other build tools.

See documentation (linked above!) for more information on using Breeze.


## History

Breeze is the merger of the ScalaNLP and Scalala projects, because one of the original maintainers is unable to continue development. The Scalala parts are largely rewritten.
